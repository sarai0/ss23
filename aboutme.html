      <li>Sarai Santiago, Im in my Freshmen year, going at Santa Ana High School.</li>
      
      <li>In middle school for 7th and 8 th grade I took a class called App Create PLTW.</li>
      
      <li>I took this course because I was interested in learning how to code and during the class I had in middle I had fun creating apps, so I figured why not join another PLTW class.</li>
      
      <li>Some of my hobbies are drawing and listening to music. I also like to watch movies on my free time and I like baking, mostly chocolate chip cookies is what I bake.</li>
